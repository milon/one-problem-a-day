We will take a simple two pointers approach, the left will be the first index. Then we iterate over the array, and every time we find a zero, we change the position of it with the next character until we reach the end or another zero.

```python
class Solution:
    def moveZeroes(self, nums: List[int]) -> None:
        l = 0
        for r in range(len(nums)):
            if nums[r] != 0:
                nums[l], nums[r] = nums[r], nums[l]
                l += 1
```
